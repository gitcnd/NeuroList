# NAME

NeuroList - Perl extension for blah blah blah

# SYNOPSIS

    use NeuroList;
    blah blah blah

# DESCRIPTION

Stub documentation for NeuroList, created by h2xs. It looks like the
author of the extension was negligent enough to leave the stub
unedited.

Blah blah blah.

\# Items to export into callers namespace by default. Note: do not export
\# names by default without a very good reason. Use EXPORT\_OK instead.
\# Do not simply export all your public functions/methods/constants.

\# This allows declaration	use NeuroList ':all';
\# If you do not need this, moving things directly into @EXPORT or @EXPORT\_OK
\# will save memory.
our %EXPORT\_TAGS = ( 'all' => \[ qw(

) \] );

our @EXPORT\_OK = ( @{ $EXPORT\_TAGS{'all'} } );

our @EXPORT = qw(

\# Preloaded methods go here.
